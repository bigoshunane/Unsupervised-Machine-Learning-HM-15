# Cryptocurrency Clusters

# Project objective
The aim of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies and create a report including the traded cryptocurrencies classified by group according to their features. The classification report could be used by an investment bank to propose a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its customers.
The original cryptocurrency data from CryptoCompare is preprocessed using Pandas to fit into Unsupervised Machine Learning models. A clustering algorithm is used to group the cleaned data and hvPlot visualization are used to show results.

The following methos applied to the given raw data:

                    . Database preprocessing,
                    
                    . Reducing the data dimension using Principal Component Analysis,
         
                    . Clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means and
 
                    . Visualizing classification results with 2D and 3D scatter plots.
